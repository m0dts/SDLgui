Example of some Touchscreen GUI parts of radio interface using SDL on the raspberry pi and C++.
Uses SDL2.0.12
The build script will help you compile it.

It's the first time i've really used C++ so apologies!

The frequency selector part works nice, never finished any of the other parts unfortunately.
